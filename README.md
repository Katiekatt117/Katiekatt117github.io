# **My Understanding of Growth Mindset**

Hi everyone!! I'm Kaitlyn Taylor but I go by Kat!!! (She/Her) I am a Memphian born and raised, I lived in Raleigh till I was 4 and then moved to Cordova and was raised there and have lived in the same spot ever since. I love anything Asian, from history to movies, from books to music, from languages to,  well, everything! :cherry_blossom::white_flower: I can't wait to travel all over Asia and possibly live and/or work there but always want to be an American! I love being creative (drawing, painting, puzzles, making things, etc), reading and watching shows, listening to all different kinds of music, playing video games, and playing/spending time with my baby: my dog Lila :dog2::heart_eyes::two_hearts: I want to be friends with absolutely EVERYONE!! :smile: I love to laugh and make others laugh. It's so nice to meet everyone and I'm so excited to start this coding journey together!

My *understanding* is that Growth Mindset is a better mindset, or way to think about things in life, to have in life. It helps you look at things in a brighter light and take on life's challenges with a better mindset.

**3 Reminders to Me to Keep a Growth Mindset:**

**1.)** When faced with criticism, learn from it

**2.)** When faced with obstacles, don't give up, push harder and persist

**3.)** When you fail, try try again!
